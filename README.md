## Try the textures in [Mineways](http://mineways.com)
[Mineways 8.0](https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/releases/tag/v8.00) includes JG RTX. [It looks pretty damn good.](http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/textures.html#candy)

## Block Properties
This is my general approach to assigning textures to blocks.

__Concrete Powder__
- Used as building-material textures, or as textures which are not intended to be used on ceilings.
- Used for tileable textures.

__Concrete__
- Used for textures which do not appear correct if rotated.
- Used for ceiling textures.

__Terracotta__
- Used for textures that can be rotated arbitrarily.

__Glazed Terracotta__
- Used for marble and terrazzo textures.

__Education Blocks__
- Used for creative or excess textures.
- Noble gases are emissive.

### So, what's with the cat stuff?

![Meow](development_resource_packs/JG-RTX/textures/blocks/mob_spawner.png)

That's Carrots the Cat! She's an [Instagram influencer](https://instagram.com/jasonjgardner/). I think it's really amusing to include her in this resource pack.
Don't worry, I'll replace the cat paintings soon.
