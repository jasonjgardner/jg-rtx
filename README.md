## Read before cloning:

__You're probably looking for the [.mcpack of the latest release](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/releases)__. A resource pack archive is attached to each release (under _Assets_ section). Download __JG-RTX.mcpack__ to use textures in Minecraft.

### [Download .mcpack from workflow runs](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/actions/workflows/main.yml)

[![.mcpack](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A .mcpack artifact is generated with each commit to the [main](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/tree/main) branch! Check the [workflow runs](https://github.com/jasonjgardner/jg-rtx/actions/workflows/main.yml) to try new textures as soon as they're available.

__Download the artifact .zip from GitHub and extract the .mcpack to install.__

> *.mcpacks produced by workflow runs are not always tested, and can not be guaranteed to work.*
