### What's with the cat stuff?

![Meow](development_resource_packs/JG-RTX/textures/blocks/mob_spawner.png)

That's Carrots the Cat! She's an [Instagram influencer](https://instagram.com/jasonjgardner/). I think it's really amusing to include her in this resource pack.
Don't worry, I'll replace the [cat paintings](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEvYkGXpwqy/) soon enough.
