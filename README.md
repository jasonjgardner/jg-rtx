## Try the textures in [Mineways](http://mineways.com)
[Mineways 8.0](https://github.com/erich666/Mineways/releases/tag/v8.00) includes JG RTX. [It looks pretty damn good.](http://www.realtimerendering.com/erich/minecraft/public/mineways/textures.html#candy)

## Texture Sets

The [texture_sets](texture_sets) directory contains _some_ premade, generated `.texture_set.json` files for copy/pasting convenience.

## Resource Packs

> **Please note:** This project is still hasn't hit beta. Textures will change. Sincerely sorry if updates mess up your creations.

The main pack in this monrepo is [JG RTX](development_resource_packs/JG-RTX). It's aimed to make generated worlds appear more realistic and to serve as a base for the more-stylized resource packs simutaneously **in development**:

- [Victorian](development_resource_packs/Victorian) - Ornate textures for a Victorian manor
- [Urbia](development_resource_packs/Urbia) - City, suburb, and modern textures
- [Fashionabwool](development_resource_packs/Fashionabwool) - Fun fabrics
- [RTXtras](development_resource_packs/RTXtras) - Experimental textures
- [RT-Exes](development_resource_packs/RT-Exes) - Textures from previous releases of JG RTX that were too far-out for the main pack, but too cool to part with.

## Behavior Packs

(Optional)

- [chunk-funcs](development_behavior_packs) One-chunk helper functions

### What's with the cat stuff?

![Meow](development_resource_packs/JG-RTX/textures/blocks/mob_spawner.png)

That's Carrots the Cat! She's an [Instagram influencer](https://instagram.com/jasonjgardner/). I think it's really amusing to include her in this resource pack.
Don't worry, I'll replace the [cat paintings](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEvYkGXpwqy/) soon enough.
