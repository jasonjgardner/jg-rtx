# To Do
(Somewhat in order of priority)

- Animate Nether portal
- Make water seamless
- Make flame animation loop seamlessly
- Create texture sets for all supported textures
- Bake textures
- Create baked entity textures

# Known Issues
Several [raytracing bugs](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360042255511-Minecraft-with-Ray-Tracing-Known-Issues-List) in Minecraft affect this resource pack.

- Normal maps and MERs are not supported in animated textures
- Entity textures do not support raytracing features
- Soul torches and lanterns do not glow blue. [This bug has been reported to Mojang](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-112916).

## Work in Progress
Unfinished textures already in repository and releases. Filler textures are better than missing textures.

- Furnace
- Crops
- Crafting tables and work benches
- Redstone dust
- etc.
